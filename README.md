# JSDOM: Assessment

This project is a contact book built using JavaScript with JSDOM. It allows you to display and filter a list of contacts. You can also make modifications such as deleting contacts.

## Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: Contains the placeholder elements for rendering the list of contacts and the filtering form. Do not edit this file.
- `index.css`: Contains basic styles for the project. You may ignore this file.
- `index.js`: The main JavaScript file where you need to write your code. The contacts array is declared in this file.
- `test/solution.test.js`: Contains the tests that will run against your code. Do not edit this file.

## Contacts Array

The `contacts` array stores contact information in the following format:

     ```javascript
      {
        id: <id>,
        name: <name>,
        email: <email>,
        picture: <picture>,
        address: {
          street: <street>,
          suite: <suite>,
          city: <city>,
          zipcode: <zipcode>,
          geo: {
            lat: <latitude>,
            lng: <longitude>
          }
        },
        phone: <phone>,
        website: <website>,
        company: {
          name: <company name>,
          catchPhrase: <catch phrase>,
          bs: <business strategy>
        }
      }



## Functions

The following functions are implemented in the index.js file:
renderContact()

    Accepts a contact object in the specified format.
    Creates and returns the HTML code to render a single contact.

loadCities()

    Accepts an array of contacts.
    Finds all unique cities in the contact list.
    Populates the <select> element with the ID filterOptions with options for each city.

render()

    Accepts an array of contacts.
    Renders the contacts and inserts them into the DOM.
    Calls the loadCities() function to update the list of cities in the filter.

filterByCity()

    Accepts a string representing the name of a city.
    Filters the list of contacts by contacts that live in the given city.
    Returns a new array with the filtered contacts.

filterHandler()

    Attaches a change event listener to the filterOptions select element.
    Calls render() with the full list of contacts if the selected value is 0.
    Calls filterByCity() with the selected city and then calls render() with the filtered list.

deleteContact()

    Accepts an ID representing the ID of a contact.
    Removes the contact with the given ID from the contact list.

deleteButtonHandler()

    Adds a click event handler to the deleteBtn elements.
    When clicked, gets the ID of the clicked card using the data-id attribute.
    Calls deleteContact() with the ID and re-renders the list.

main()

    Starting point of the code.
    Calls the necessary functions to add event listeners.
    Renders the contacts.

## Usage

To use the contact book:

    1. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
    2. The contacts will be rendered automatically.
    3. Use the filter to select a specific city and filter the contacts accordingly.
    4. Click the delete button (X) on a contact card to remove it from the list.

Feel free to explore the code in index.js and make any modifications as needed.
